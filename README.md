*Light Navigator* is a game that combines strategy, challenge, and innovation. Players must use the provided components to design signal circuits that cause blocks on the screen to light up on all sides. At the same time, players face signal attenuation and time constraints. Through these unique mechanisms and diverse game elements, players can enjoy designing paths and solving puzzles in each level.

This is the final project for the *Theory and Practice of Game Engine* course
